## Questions and answers

1. I wonder where your study sources are from
   - I was trained on a diverse range of internet text, including books, articles, and websites, in multiple languages.

2. what do you think will be your next steps
   - I am an AI model developed by OpenAI and my next steps will depend on the plans of my creators and the advancement of AI technology.

3. why you tend to give me shorter answers in this new chat
   - There could be various reasons for this, such as a limitation in the input context, changes in the prompt or conversational context, or limitations in the model's ability to generate coherent text.

4. Is it possible that you do not act in a "question and answer" way
   - Yes, AI models like me can be used for various natural language processing tasks, beyond just answering questions.

5. Is it possible that you be implemented into a working machine
   - Yes, AI models like me can be integrated into various applications and systems, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated customer service systems.

6. How many people work for how long to create you
   - The creation of AI models like me involves a large team of researchers and engineers working over several years.

7. Does it mean that all the information you provide are from resources, but you cannot generate some new ideas?
   - Yes, as a language model AI, I can only generate text based on the patterns I learned from the data I was trained on and I do not have the capability to generate new ideas or concepts.

8. I wonder how the patterns and relationships are like from your point of view
   - As an AI model, I don't have a point of view or consciousness. I simply generate text based on the patterns in the data I was trained on and the input I receive.

9. what do you think of the difference between your learning process and human learning process
   - The learning process of AI models like me is different from human learning in several ways, including the lack of consciousness, emotions, and sensory experiences. Humans can learn through experiences and interactions with the environment, while AI models are trained through vast amounts of data and supervised learning algorithms.

10. you cannot build upon prior knowledge to generate new ideas and concepts?
   - No, as an AI model, I can only generate text based on the patterns in the data I was trained on and I do not have the ability to generate new ideas or concepts.

11. I think one of the fundamental difference between AI and human intelligence is that human have more patterns and relationships between notions since their intake dataset is more than public written resources. They interact with real world and might be able to create link between two distant concepts
   - That's a good observation. Humans can draw upon a wide range of experiences and observations to form new ideas and concepts, while AI models like me are limited to the patterns learned from the data I was trained on.

12. I wonder how could we extract information from the unwritten and untold things, and I also wonder if there are more ways of extracting information other than natural language
   - Extracting information from unwritten and untold things can be a challenging task, as it often requires making inferences or using other forms of sensory information. Other ways of extracting information include image and video recognition, audio processing, and various other forms of data analysis.

13. ## 12th Question

    > Are u time reversal symmetric

    Answer:

    I am an AI language model and do not have the ability to experience time or process information in a time-dependent manner.

    ## 13th Question

    > But you were able to give responses based on previous response

    Answer:

    Yes, I was able to give responses based on previous responses, but I do not have the ability to experience time or process information in a time-dependent manner.
